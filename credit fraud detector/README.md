# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project, I will create different classification models and test how precise they are in identifying whether the transaction is a normal or a fraud. This dataset is published on Kaggle and it contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days. <br> 
Before moving forward, I want to highlight that the features in the dataset are scaled and the names of the features are hidden due to privacy reasons. However, I'll still analyze some details of the dataset.

### Goals:
1. Exploring the dataset.
2. Dealing with imbalanced class distribution.
3. Creating and testing classification models, choosing the most accurate model.

### Metrics:
1. AUC Score
2. F1 Score
3. Accuracy Score

### Models:
1. Logistic Regression (Ridge regularization)
2. Gaussian Naive Bayes
3. SVC
4. SGBoost
5. AdaBoost
7. Voting Ensemble
