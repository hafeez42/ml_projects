# Classification of News Headlines (Unsupervised NLP)

In this project I'll attempt to build multilabel classification models to identify the category of a given news title.

## Goals:
 - Feature generation. `Bag of Words` vs `Latent Semantic Analysis`
 - Predict outcome variables - `Supervised Learning` (classification)
 
## Dataset: 
URL: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/news-aggregator-dataset

This dataset contains headlines, URLs, and categories for 422,937 news stories collected by a web aggregator between March 10th, 2014 and August 10th, 2014.
News categories included in this dataset include business; science and technology; entertainment; and health. Different news articles that refer to the same news item (e.g., several articles about recently released employment statistics) are also categorized together.
