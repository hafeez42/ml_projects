# Building ML NLP model on Amazon Food Reviews Dataset

##**Objective:**
The purpose of the project is to do basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and make prediction based on reviews as whether the review is Positive or Negative.


Sentiment analysis of feedbacks helps the companies to improve several important points.

It's almost impossible to receive be 100% accuracy. And of course, a machine does not understand sarcasm or humor. However, according to a research, people do not agree 80% of the time. It means that even if the machine accuracy does not score a perfect 100, it will still be more accurate than human analysis. Companies using Sentiment Analysis applications are able to save more resources (time and money) which they can invest in other aspects of their businesses.
